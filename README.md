This is a full stack application that enables the user to create, study and maintain a deck of study cards, similar to the software Anki. I created this project to learn the following backend technologies: nodeJs, expressJs and mongoDB.

It was also used as a study case in "Introducci√≥n a la Criptograf√≠a y a la Seguridad de la Informaci√≥n" class, where various security techniques were applied to reduce the vulnerability of the application against some of the most common cyber-security attacks, reported by the OWASP in 2022.
